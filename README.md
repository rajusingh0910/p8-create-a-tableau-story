## Background

I chose to create a visualization of Baseball Test data. The data can also be accessed in this repo in the data folder.

## Design

I chose to tell a data story using the Tableau Story tool. After doing exploratory data analysis on the dataset

### Card 1:

### Card 2: 
Tallest Player in the data
### Card 3: 
Heaviest Player in the data
### Card 4: 
Player with the highest run 
### Card 5: 
No. of Records by the player
### Card 6: 
Avg on the basis of handedness
### Card 7: 
Highest run on the basis of handedness
### Card 8: 
No. of records on the basis of handedness

Result found are

### Card 1: 
Bobby Mitchell has highest avg. of 0.4780

### Card 3:

## Feedback
